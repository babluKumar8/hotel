              to a safe place from Vrindavan to protect it from the destructive wrath of Mughal emperor Aurangzeb. 
              But when the bullock cart reached the spot the wheel broke down and got stuck deep in mud, it became
               impossible for them to move further ahead - that moment the priest accompanying realized that the Lord doesn't
